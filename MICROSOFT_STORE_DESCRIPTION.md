## Short description
A modern Windows video player with tabbed playback, session restore, and a privacy‑friendly local history.

## Description
Insait Video Player is a modern video player for Windows built with Avalonia UI and a VLC-based media engine (LibVLC). It’s designed for people who watch local video files and want fast navigation, convenient tabbed playback, and session restore.

Open multiple videos at once, switch between tabs, and pick up where you left off. The app remembers playback positions and can restore your previous session. You can also select your preferred audio output device.

### Key features
- Plays many common video formats (powered by LibVLC)
- Tabbed interface for multiple videos with overflow handling
- Session management: auto-save and restore your playback session
- Playback history with position memory
- Audio output device selection
- Keyboard shortcuts for efficient control
- Multi-language UI: Ukrainian, English, German, Russian, Turkish

### Privacy & data storage
Your history and session data are stored locally on your device. The app uses Windows DPAPI encryption for protected storage.

### Good to know
- Hardware acceleration depends on VLC capabilities and your system configuration.
- Some uncommon (“exotic”) formats may not be supported.
- The first launch may take longer due to VLC initialization.

## System requirements
- Windows 10 or later
- .NET 10.0 Runtime
